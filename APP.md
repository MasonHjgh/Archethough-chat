# App Usage
This describes the usage of the app and lists screens. These are beginning suggestions, as we do not have any user feedback.  Developers may use their discretion and creativity.  The one thing to keep is the reordered list mechanism. This is one thing that has been asked for specifically.

## Flow Description 


**1. Welcome Screen:**
   - Upon opening the app for the first time, users are greeted with an image that visually represents the concept and purpose of the Personal Village.

**2. Sign-Up/Log-In Screen:**
   - Users can either create a new account or log in to an existing account.
   - Fields for entering email and password are provided.
   - In the future, there may be a "forgot password" link for account recovery.

**3. Logout/Exit Screen:**
   - Users have the option to log out or exit the app.

**4. Dashboard/Home Screen:**
   - After logging in, users are directed to the dashboard, which serves as the central hub of the app.

         - Red: Sends a preset message to the designated group in case of a true emergency.
